          <h2>THE PRINCIPALITY OF MIDBURLAND</h2>
          <p>
            "Midburland? The north is real nice - they got fertile fields, sturdy roofs, and flushing shitters.
            Down here you're lucky to have walls thick enough to protect your hide from the bandits and beasts - the
            real ugly sons-a-bitches that reside out there in the swamplands."

              -Lenny Shagrits, Boghelm resident
          </p>
          <p>
          North Midburland is a relatively peaceful continent. The same cannot be said for the South.
          The land is best understood as three disparate lands strung together.
          Northern Midburland is a wide, lush continent with a diverse ecosystem and thriving population of humanoids and creatures.
          Southern Midburland is a land of steep, jagged, untraversable cliffs dispersed by lowly swamps and wetlands rife with unfavorable
          wildlife, speckled with shantytowns and fishing villages.
          The two lands are attached by a terrible stretch of dense forest known as the Tether. Nobody lives in the Tether, at least not for very long.
          The coastal oceans of Midburland are plagued by frequent storms and tumultuous waves, making conventional sailing ill-advised.

          <h3>BOGHELM</h3>
          <p>
          Boghelm is where your journey begins. A meager fishing village built on a strip of grasslands amongst a swamp teeming with
          fish of all shapes and sizes.

          The Boathouse:
          The swampy forest abruptly gives way to a small sandy shore, atop which perches a pier and its accompanying boathouse. The mahogany wood looks
          sturdy and ornate, sharply contrasting with most of the shoddy infrastructure you're used to seeing in Boghelm.  The pier houses a few skiffs
          and two larger ships, and on the right is an elevated boathouse with intricately carved windows and a thatch roof.  Through the window, you
          can see a group of people and racks stacked with canoes.
          </p>
          <h3>CITY</h3>
          <p>
          Bulletin: antidotes are dispersed among the population based on occupation. One determined citizen compiles the amount from members of each
          occupation and hangs it behind the town hall. Numbers change based upon the will of the king, with some occupations, such as guards, missing.
